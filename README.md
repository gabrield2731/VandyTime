# VandyTime

## Project Overview
VandyTime is a web application designed to revolutionize the way Vanderbilt students choose and register for classes. Inspired by BerkeleyTime.com, our platform provides students with detailed insights into courses by displaying grade distributions, reviews, and comparisons between professors. Users can log in, submit grades, and write qualitative reviews to help fellow students make informed decisions when selecting their classes.

## Key Features
- **Course Insights**: View grade distributions and read student reviews for every course in the catalog.
- **Filtering Options**: Filter data by professor, year, and semester for a more tailored view of course performance.
- **Professor Comparisons**: Compare grade distributions across professors teaching the same course to find the best fit.
- **User Submissions**: Log in with Vanderbilt credentials to submit grades and qualitative reviews, contributing to the data pool.
- **Interactive Interface**: A clean, graphical interface that simplifies finding and comparing courses.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Built with React.js to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **Backend**: Flask framework for handling API requests and backend logic.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data, reviews, and course information.
- **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting and deploying the app.
